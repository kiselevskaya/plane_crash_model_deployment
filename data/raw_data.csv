12.10.1997;17:28:00;Monterey Bay, near Pacific Grove, California;Rutan Long EZ (experimental aircraft);Private;;54;'-;No;;1;0;1;0;0;N555JD;The aircraft had just finished performing 3 touch-and-go landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge.

After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning left and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures. Specifically both pilots  had trained in the Soviet Union, where the attitude indicator works differently. Theirs show an icon of the airplane changing position in front of a fixed horizon, mimicking what an observer outside the plane would see if there was daylight; but western type indicators show a fixed airplane icon and an artificial horizon changing position, mimicking what the pilot would see.  Consequently the diagonal line on the display is angled the same way for a right turn on one type as for a left turn on the other type."

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C."

Failure of the two pilots to coordinate their actions during the initial approach, with the final approach attempted below the minimum descent altitude and the runway not visible. Realizing that the approach had been misjudged, the co-pilot, who was in command, attempted to pull the plane up in order to perform a new landing, which disabled the auto pilot, but the captain had retaken control of the aircraft without informing his co-pilot, leading to the crash. Lack of coordination between the two pilots and the inappropriate application of flight control inputs during the attemped go-around. The length of the trip and crew fatigue was a factor.

The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover.

All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades.

The plane was accelerating on runway 16 when it collided with a fire truck, which crossed the active runway without authorization. The crew rejected the takeoff at high speed (at about 130 knots) but wasn't able to avoid contact with the fire truck. As a result of the collision, the right main gear collapsed and caught fire due to the resulting friction against the runway. The aircraft veered right towards the right-hand runway edge coming to a stop partially off the runway about 2500 meters down the runway. Everyone on board was able to evacuate the plane, however, some sustained injuries. Two firefighters in the fire truck were killed.

The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. The French government convicted Continental and a Continental mechanic of a crime but an appeals court reversed the decision.

Inadvertent deployment of the spoilers by the first officer while the aircraft was still in the air. Faulty design by allowing the spoiler handle to perform two different unrelated tasks (lift to arm and pull to deploy). After the crash McDonnell Douglas denied there was any design flaw and the FAA decided to issue an Airworthiness Directive requiring a warning placard on all DC8s. After two and possibly three more crashed with the same cause an AD was issued requiring a safety lock be installed.

The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable."

They departed Archerfield (Brisbane) at 0622 EST and refuelled at Charleville, Cloncurry, and Daily Waters, departing from Daily Waters at 1655 Central Standard time. From there a chain of events happened and they remained lost in scattered thunderstorms and drizzle and the blacked out North, being told by Darwin D/F that they were over a hundred miles north of where they really were, due to the inadequacies of the equipment at that time of day, the storms and long distance. In an attempt to force land before running out of fuel, they probably had an engine failure from fuel starvation in the lower engine as they oozed around in a slow turn where the captain would have been peering forward out of an open window, trying to locate a lighter (more grassy) spot in the bush to put down in rain. They probably would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top. The wreckage was found on 6/22/1943.


We feel that they would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top as one wing was undamaged and removed from the site when it was found.

As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing.

Pieces struck the fuselage, breaking a window, causing rapid explosive decompression and a passenger Mr. Gardner, sitting in seat 17H was sucked out of the plane.  The plane landed safely. His body was found two years later. The captain and flight engineer were experimenting with the autothrottle system by tripping the circuit breakers which supplied the instruments which measured the rotational speed of each engine's low pressure compressor. This led to engine overspeeding and destruction of the engine.

The Connie was cleared to land at La Guardia Airport on Runway 04 when the United DC-8 struck the Connie tearing it apart. The Connie immediately crashed to the ground at Miller Army Air Field on Staten Island. One passenger was sucked out into one of the DC8s jet engines. Other passengers fell from the Connie as the spinning fuselage fell onto Staten Island. The United jet tried to make an emergency landing at La Guardia Airport but could not maintain altitude and crashed into the streets of Brooklyn. Forty-four people on the Constellation and eight-four people on the DC-8 were killed. Three passengers from the DC-8 died shortly after. One young boy, Stephen Baltz survived several days before succumbing to his injuries. Six people were also killed on the ground. The United crew entered a low-altitude holding pattern at 500 miles per hour, twice the speed it should have been going and flew past the clearance limits and airspace allocated to the flight. One of 2 VORs on the DC-8 was not functioning. Although the crew knew this, they failed to report this to the ATC, who probably would have provided extra radar assistance.

Both planes were traveling about 320 mph. Both aircraft were flying in uncontrolled airspace. All  fifty-eight on the DC-7 and seventy on the Constellation killed. The pilots did not see each other in time to avoid the collision. It is not possible to determine why the pilots did not see each other, but the evidence suggests that it resulted from any one or a combination of the following factors: 1) Intervening clouds reducing time for visual separation 2) Visual limitations due to cockpit visibility 3) Preoccupation with normal cockpit duties. This is the accident that led to the adoption of the Air Route Traffic Centers that track planes across the country and the formation of the FAA.

The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence.

The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point.

The pilot sent out a distress call and was given clearance to return to the airport. The crash site, some 31 miles southeast of the airport, contained a smoky crater with small pieces of wreckage. When the 737 Max 8 was designed, it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this, the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this, not the pilots or  airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude, it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane, the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude, but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane’s stall speed was reached, and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem.

The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term ""we need priority"" several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say ""we are running out of fuel"" numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted.

The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine's PT2 probe was responsible for the accident.

Five passengers and two crew members on the Embraer were not injured. All 154 on board the 737 were killed. The flight recorder transcript from the executive jet showed that the pilots were told by Brazilian air traffic control to fly at the same altitude as the Boeing 737 before the planes collided. A Brazilian Air Force investigation concluded that a switched-off transponder on the EMB-135 contributed the plane crash. The report also said flight controllers failed to alert the pilots they were on a collision course and failed to notice the transponder was turned off.

Contact was lost about 40 minutes after taking off. Before contact was lost, the pilot requested a route change due to weather conditions. Preliminary indications are the plane ran into poor weather and stalled from FL320. The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer, who was flying, became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash. Records show that the plane flew with that mechanical problem for 12 months preceding the accident.

Then a sudden tail wind increases the speed to 155 kt. Cross winds from several directions made the plane unstable. Tail winds alternated with frontal winds making the speed unstable. The plane only hit the runway after 800m. The same cross winds make it impossible to align to the center of the runway. Then aquaplaning did the rest.

A strong southerly wind required the aircraft to make a turn and approach the runway from the north. The aircraft crashed near the peak of Mt. Mulbong, approximately 3 mile north of the runway. The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final. The flight crew performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air China’s operations and training manuals. 
The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captain’s intention to make a timely base turn. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. When the first officer advised the captain to ascend again for landing, about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself."

Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked ""guard lights"" used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmac at the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R.

Both planes were headed to London, at the same altitude, but different airways. When the Convair was at the ATC sector boundary, the crew could barely hear the Marina controller who instructed them to contact Menhir control. The pilot erroneously thought he had to contact Menhir control when passing the Nantes VOR. In order to delay their arrival at the VOR the Convair crew twice tried to request permission to carry out a 360-degree turn. When they did not get any answer from Marina control, they initiated the turn without clearance. While in the midst of an overcast, the Convair collided with the DC-9. The CV-990 lost an outboard portion of its left wing and managed to carry out an emergency landing at Cognac-Châteaubernard Air Base. The DC-9 lost control and crashed.

The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.

It was on a short 1 hour flight to Pangkal Pinang. After taking off from runway 25L, the aircraft made a climbing left-hand turn after which the crew radioed a request to return too the airport. The aircraft then showed an erratic pattern of flight and began losing altitude until it crashed into the sea, 9 miles off the Jakarta coast. It was reported the plane had problems the night before on a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta. When the 737 Max 8 was designed, it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this, the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this, not the pilots or  airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude, it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane, the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude, but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane’s stall speed was reached, and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem.

The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight..

Radar contact was lost 9 minutes into the flight. The crash site was found on the 3rd day of searching in the San Bernardino Mountains. An investigation revealed the aircraft flew, inverted, into a solid wall of granite between two mountain peaks at an altitude of 3,750 feet  and at an estimated speed of 560 mph. The aircraft was literally pulverized into the granite.

This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner."

Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services.

Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots. 
  The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It's unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed."

The plane began dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing when it disappeared from radar and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Halifax. A fire in the entertainment system wiring started in a hidden area above the cockpit ceiling when arcing ignited the cover material made of thermal insulation blankets. This set off an in-flight fire that spread and increased in intensity until it led to the loss of the aircraft.. It was determined that  aircraft certification standards for material flammability at the time of the accident were inadequate. Dr. Jonathan Mann, researcher in the fight against AIDS and Joseph LaMotta, son of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, killed in the crash.

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists.

The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.

The aircraft crashed while trying to return to the airport. Loss of hydraulics and electrical systems after a fire, started in the wheel when two tires disintegrated due to under inflation of one tire. This caused a fire which ignited years of accumulated flammables in the DC-8's wheel well leading to an uncontroable fire. The plane was allowed to leave with an under inflated tire. Twenty minutes prior to departure, the Nationair lead mechanic made a request for nitrogen to inflate the low tire. Nitrogen was not readily available and a delay would probably have occur procuring it. The Nationair project manager, without conferring with the flight crew, released the plane.

The accident was caused by the FAA's failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. In addition, Embraer's manual for the aircraft specified correctly that the deicing boots should be activated as soon as icing occured.  But the pilots were trained by Comair's manual, which specified waiting until ice was about 1/2 inch thick.

Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft.

22.11.1961;;Harare, Zimbabwe;;Rhodesian Air Services;Salisbury - Livingstone - Elizabethville;19351;;No;;3;0;3;0;0;VP-YRX;The aircraft was on a charter flight to Livingstone to pick up United Nations troops on leave and take them back to Elizabethville. It took off from Salisbury Airport, and shortly after take-off suddenly dipped its right wing. After a slow recovery, it climbed away to between 100 - 150 ft and then went into a turn to the left with the port propeller windmilling. This turn continued to get steeper until the aircraft rolled over and dived inverted to the ground . The accident was caused by failure of the pilot to execute a successful single engine forced landing after concluding that there had been a power loss in the port engine. Evidence indicated that a failure of the port engine did not, in fact, occur. The pre-take-off rudder trimmer check was not carried out correctly as laid down in the checklist, and the aircraft took off with full left rudder trim applied. Once airborne this was misinterpreted as port engine failure, and the port propeller was feathered. No apparent action was taken by the pilot to correct the ensuing critical speed yaw.

The plane crashed into Trinity Bay and broke apart in muddy water about 5 feet deep.  The probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captain’s failure to adequately monitor the airplane’s flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industry’s selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officer’s aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration’s failure to implement the pilot records database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.

When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport. The accident was the consequence of manuvering the aircraft during the turn to final approach in such a manner as to cause a rate of sink from which recovery was not possible. Sometime during the turn the flaps were retracted from 60% to 24% causing a loss of lift.

The aircraft made a continuous descent at an average rate of approximately 2,000 feet per minute from 35,000 feet to impact with the water in a clean flight configuration. Officially, a cause could not be determined. The aircraft was dispatched illegally without an operating CVR. Possible misread altimeter. The crew could have read the altimeter as 16,000 instead of  6,000 ft. and continued a descent below what they were cleared for. Possible excessive sink rate. Excessive sink rate is thought to have possibly caused four 727 accidents in succession. Lake Michigan 8/16/65, Cincinnati 11/8/65, Salt Lake City 11/11/65 and Tokyo Bay 2/4/66. Only the Salt Lake and Cincinnati crashes were officially attributed to it. After 727 training manuals were modified and pilots were reoriented to the flying characteristics of the aircraft the problem was corrected.

The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.

The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander's unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander's failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle.
The commander's failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown."

The two pilots and two pasengers survived the accident. Overspeeding of both propellers. The plane had to be manually flown because the aircraft's yaw damper was unserviceable. Neither pilot noticed the aircraft's speed increasing to its maximum operating speed. The pilot-in-command pulled the power levels of the plane 'quite quickly'. Moments later both propellers over-sped simultaneously. The over-speeding propellers back-drove the turbines in the engines (instead of the engine turbines driving the propellers) and this caused severe damage to the left engine.After the emergency began, the first officer quickly identified the double propeller over-speed. At about the same time, smoke appeared in the cockpit and various aircraft system malfunction alerts activated.

The plane continued to fly for a short time after which the fuselage came apart and the plane crashed in a ball of flames. Julian Frank, who had purchased 1 million dollars in insurance, was suspected of committing suicide by detonating the bomb in his lap or under his seat. There is a possibility Frank may have been an unwitting bomb carrier and that this bombing has something to do with the National Airlines crash of November, 16, 1959. No one was charged in either case.

The high rate of descent in the final phase of the approach and the landing made on the right landing gear which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft.The crosswind, which exceeded the aircrafts limits and which occurred in the final phase of the approach and during landing. The combination of both factors caused stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. In addition, there were four moments when the pilots should have decided to abort the landing and do a go-around. This because the runway was flooded with water, the plane had left the flight path and was unstable during landing. In addition, the pilots did not properly correct for the windshear, flew too slowly and made errors with the automatic pilot.

Climbing through FL110 the aircraft lost the rear cargo door, resulting in explosive decompression and damage to the cabin floor and control cables. The aircraft lost control and crashed in a forest at a high rate of speed. The service subcontractor and the flight engineer neglected to check the locking mechanism through a recently installed viewport to verify the door was latched properly. In addition, although a service bulletin stipulated that the locking pin should be extended, it was mistakenly shortened causing the latch to release after the cabin was pressurized. On June 12, 1972, an American Airlines DC-10 lost its cargo door shortly after taking off from Detroit ,Michigan. Using mainly engine thrust the crew was able to land safely. The cause was a defect in the latching mechanism on the door.

The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazakstan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight.

Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. As a failsafe, the latches should have been blocked from moving by a mechanism called a ""locking sector"" (one on each latch), engaged manually by a lever after the door is closed.  However, the locking sectors as designed were not strong enough and could be overcome by the motors which was a design flaw right from the introduction of the747.  This was finally recognized as serious, after a non-fatal failure in 1987, but installing stronger locking sectors required taking each plane out of service 10 hours, and the FAA had allowed airlines 18 months so they could do it during other maintenance procedures."

Due to closed airports and inadequate repair facilities, the pilot chose to continue to its destination. Several hours later, the remaining engines overheated and the No.2 engine caught fire causing the plane to crash. Gene Roddenberry (creator of Star Trek) was a deadheading Pan Am pilot aboard, who helped rescue many of the passengers.  The crash was blamed on Pan Am's failure to replace the No. 2 engine which had experienced several problems earlier.  A fire which resulted from an attempt to feather the No. 2 propeller after the failure of the No. 2 engine thrust bearing. The aircraft was named Clipper Eclipse.

The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway.

However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor.

The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and it’s generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function."" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the ""OFF"" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses. The galley switches were similar in shape and size, and were located on the flight engineer's upper panel in close proximity to the battery switch. Following the accident, the flight engineer’s panel was redesigned to place a guard over the battery switch."

Several eye-witnesses reported that the aircraft lost some pieces before it came down. Investigations determined that following the failure of a part of the right aileron, it detached from the wing, causing severe vibrations.

The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft.

The airplane then crashed into the sea and broke apart off the shores of Masbate Island some 980 ft away from the island's airport. An investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely, 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with one engine inoperative, in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon; and that during his last flight proficiency test he had not been tested with respect to flying with one engine inoperative."

Preliminary evidence suggests the crew selected the landing gear down and set the flaps 15 degrees. Immediately after selecting the flaps the stick shaker activated. The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft's instruments and failed to follow the airline's procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.

Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.

The delayed arming of the engine ice-protection systems while flying through icing conditions, causing eventual flame-out of the four engines. This condition existed for sufficient time to cause a drop in battery electrical energy, preventing the unfeathering and relighting of sufficient engines to maintain flight. The aircraft was then dived in an  effort to attain sufficient airspeed to drive the propellers out of the feathered positions by wind-milling.  At the same time, multiple attempts were made to relight one or more engines. Successful relights were either interrupted by auto-feather action initiated by premature advancing of the throttles prior to complete light up of an engine or prevented by insufficient battery electrical energy. No. 4 engine was eventually  relit and the crew had just successfully relit No. 3 engine when the aircraft crashed.

The previous two planes took off from Runway 22 without any problems. The flightcrew was cleard to taxi to Runway 22 and subsequently cleared for takeoff. However, flight 5191 used Runway 26, which is about half the length of Runway 22. The plane accelerated to 137 knots befoe it ran off the end of the runway, ran through an airport perimeter fence and impacted trees on an adjacent horse farm and burst into flames. The takeoff sequence took about 36 seconds.  The aircraft was still on the ground as the plane ran off the runway.The plane came to rest about 1,800 feet past the runway. It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.

Official PC: The accident was caused by loss of control due to the destruction of primary control surfaces in the tail section, which, in turn, was caused by aeroelastic oscillations initiated by abnormal clearances in the vertical stabilizer attachments to the fuselage structure.
The condition of the attachments was a result of excessive wear in pins and sleeves used in this structural joint. The pins and sleeves were of an inferior quality and did not satisfy specified values for hardness and tensile strength. They had also been installed and inspected using sub-standard maintenance procedures. Undamped oscillations in the elevator contributed to the structural failure of the empennage."""

The pilot discovered the left engine was overspeeding and made an abrupt left turn to land at Kung-Kuan Military Air Base. During the turn he lost control and crashed into mountains. Probable cause: About 5 miles west of the accident site was Kung-Kuan Military Air Base. Six miles south-southwest was Shui-Nan Airport from where the aircraft took off. On the right side of the flight pattern was a chain of mountains. It was concluded that, when the pilot found that the left engine was overspeeding, he made an abrupt left turn to land at Kung-Kuan Military Air Base or return to Shui-Nan Airport.

Failure of the crew to monitor altitude and descent rate and the failure of the 1st officer to provide the captain with the required altitude and approach performance call-outs. Also the flight engineer disabled the GPWS alarm so the crew could hear one another better. In addition, the night flight had been diverted from its primary airport due to poor weather and was required to execute a compressed approach (descending and approaching more quickly and steeply than normal), and the crucial altimeter readout was an old drum-roll-counter type (due to be replaced), which could easily be misread, especially in  heavy workload situations. Three fatalities occurred when the frightened passengers grabbed their seat cushions and exited the plane from the rear. They drowned in part because their seat cushions were not flotation cushions. The airplane was not required to have floatation cushions because it was not flying over water.

The plane then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team. The pilot reported to ATC he had runaway trim prior to the accident. The pilot's mismanagement of an abnormal flight control situation through improper actions including lack of crew coordination and failing to control airspeed and to prioritize control of the airplane. The event was controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. By allowing their airplane's speed to increase while engaging in poorly coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed and abnormal situation to escalate to an emergency.

The crew made an emergency landing in the Bengawan Solo River, in shallow water. The plane circled several times before diving in a steep course towards the river. The plane's left wing struck a river bank before it plunged into the water. The reason the crew flew into extreme weather was the heavy rain and hail was shadowed on the radar and blocked from radar view. In addition, the airplane had a partially failed battery which was exhausted by two attempts to restart the engines, producing a total electrical failure. A flight attendant drowned in the shallow water when she jumped from the plane.

Since no external power unit was available at the airport the engine could not be shut down and deicing could not be performed. The captain's decision to take off  in deteriorating weather conditions with an accumulation of snow and ice on the wings.  Decision not to de-ice the plane before taking off. The failure of the Canadian air transport system in placing the crew in a situation where they did not have the resources to make a proper decision.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, except for some parts of the airport which were obscured by low cloud.  Approaching Runway 28, the aircraft was too high to land and the pilot chose instead to enter a right downwind to land on Runway 10.  At approximately 400 feet above ground level on final for Runway 10, the aircraft entered some clouds, the base of which were reported by the tower operator to be at 10 meters.  The aircraft continued its descent, initially striking some trees about 400 feet short of the runway, then shearing off one of the main landing gear on a hillside road about 200 feet prior to the runway.  The aircraft, under full power and nose up, began to climb, but rolled inverted and crashed at the threshold of Runway 10.  The wing fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuselage, trailing fire, slid across the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway.  A fire ensued and airport fire and rescue crews put out the fire within 10 minutes.  Both pilots and one passenger were killed by impact and the remaining four passengers were taken to the hospital with moderate injuries.  The primary cause of the accident was the pilot's decision to descend without visual reference to the surface.  A contributing factor was the negative affect on crew performance that resulted from not using oxygen at 12,000 feet during the flight from Ciudad Guayana.

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.

Wreckage was scattered over a wide area of over 1 km. Authorities confirmed the aircraft was intact until the time of impact. There were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The probable cause was due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions from unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing  of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control of the aircraft,

The pilot's 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot's seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music.

Soon after the plane impacted mountainous terrain approximately 22 miles south of Medellin. Members of the Brazilian Chapecoense soccer team were among those killed. Among the errors made which caused the crash were the decisions to let the plane take off without enough fuel to make the flight safely and then to not stop midway to refuel. The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late. In addition, as the fuel was running out, they extended the flaps and gear just before the engines stopped, but this caused enough drag that they could no longer glide to the airport. Since the captain was part owner of the small airline, he was motivated to cut fuel costs because the company was in financial trouble.

Descending through 260 feet AGL the aircraft began to deviate below the glide slope, a ‘GLIDESLOPE’ warning occurred. Descending between 180 to 40 feet the engine thrust was increased causing the aircraft to accelerate to 164 knots. At 16 feet AGL the speed was 170 KIAS. A Terrain Awareness Warning System aural signal ‘Retard’ occurred. The engine thrust was reduced to idle.

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots  were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain's decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators."

In addition, there was a thin layer of ice on the aircraft's wings. The flight crew's failure to effectively monitor and maintain airspeed and comply with procedures for deice boot activation on the approach, which caused an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the FAA's failure to establish adequate certification requirements for flight into icing conditions, which led to the inadequate stall warning margin provided by the airplane's stall warning system.

Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed.
